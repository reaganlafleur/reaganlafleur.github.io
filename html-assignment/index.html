        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in The Bahamas, then moved to Canada on the 30<sup>th</sup> October 2021. Interestingly, I sometimes prefer the cold to insufferable heat and humidity, that makes you not want to be in your own skin. Nonetheless, it's a personal goal of mine to try both skiing and snowboarding, and to reach a professional level at ice skating.</p>
        <p>I believe my favorite hobby has to be watching movies and tv shows. I think this comes from a core memory I have watching Marvel, <abbr title="Detective Comics">DC</abbr> and also every horror/thriller movie known to man, every spooky speason with my dad and brother since I was a child. Now could my hemophobia be due to the amount of stabbing I've watched in the Scream franchise? Possibly. But did I feel <strong>tough</strong> being able to watch the <em>scary</em> movies with the boys? Yes.</p>
